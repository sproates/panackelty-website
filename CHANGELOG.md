# Changelog

Notable changes to Panackelty are recorded here. Preview releases may change
source syntax, checking behavior, standard-library APIs, and bytecode as described
in `RELEASE_POLICY.md`.

## Unreleased

- Check staged namespace declaration/signature identities and public access,
  including generic/callable types and guard-helper dependencies. Namespace
  execution remains gated; this internal preparation adds no executable syntax.
- Retain identity-bound staged function bodies and check a bounded annotated-local,
  direct-call, explicit-generic and return subset. Deferred inference, proofs,
  effects and emission still block namespace execution.

## 0.1.0-alpha.11 — 2026-10-04

### Features and fixes

- Add finite concurrent TCP servers through `await tcp_serve`, named async
  handlers and `TcpServerLimits` from `stdlib/tcp`. Native Linux/macOS execution
  owns connections, deadlines and drain/cancellation cleanup; embedded listening
  is separately opt-in and browsers return unavailable. This additive API
  retains bytecode v9 and is not part of alpha.10 downloads.

- Add `await tcp_exchange(...)` for bounded native IPv4 request/response, with
  nonblocking partial I/O, total timeout, response limits and owned cleanup.
  Source and saved-bytecode clients work on Linux/macOS; WASI returns an explicit
  unavailable error. Embedded native execution requires opt-in. DNS, TLS,
  stream handles and source spawning are not included in this client API.
- Refresh the v9 compiler seed and both verifiers for the additive async builtin;
  existing v9 artifacts keep their meaning. Alpha.10 lacks the new builtin.

- Add optional compiler source-map sidecars and `panack locate` for bounded
  instruction lookup against exactly reproduced local source. Sidecars contain
  source text: review them before sharing. Unavailable lookup is explicit;
  automatic runtime source errors and stack explanations are not included.
- Add `panack explain` for bounded natural-number subtraction proofs and local
  call/await effect boundaries. Valid sibling functions can still be explained
  after a function-body type error. Explanations do not certify whole-program
  validity or provide transitive effects or runtime provenance.
- Index declaration lookup to improve compiler-sized workloads without changing
  language behavior or promising a speedup for every program.

### Checking changes and migration

- Invalidate guard proofs when mutable values change. Programs incorrectly
  accepted using stale guard facts can now be rejected; establish the required
  proof again after mutation rather than relying on the old value's guard.
- Bytecode remains v9. The alpha.11 commands and TCP additions above are
  not available in the alpha.10 native downloads or the pinned playground.

### Development and website

- Add a reproducible isolated build/validation baseline with explicit source,
  toolchain, cache and workload records. This measures existing behavior; it does
  not introduce dependency-aware compilation or weaken invalidation checks.
  Controlled clean validation remains above its 120-second target, and warm
  compiler validation remains above 15 seconds; performance work continues.
- Generate website release history from this changelog, distinguish prepared
  notes from verified downloads, and share navigation and footers across the
  homepage, history and playground without changing the pinned browser runtime.

### Installation and staged development

- Add an optional installer for the already published alpha.10 native archives,
  with checksum verification and versioned ownership-safe installation. This is
  an installation convenience, not a new binary release or supported platform.
- Stage namespace metadata and binding infrastructure. Public namespace forms
  still fail closed; executable namespace support has not shipped.

## 0.1.0-alpha.10 — 2026-09-30

### Breaking changes and migration

- Saved bytecode moves from v8 to v9. Recompile existing `.bc` files from source;
  the VM rejects v8 artifacts. Source checking, the compiler seed and runtime
  are packaged together.
- `Option[T]`, `Result[T,E]` and their constructors are implicit. Remove imports
  used only for these types; their names can no longer be redeclared.
- Remove `stdlib/text` and `stdlib/collections` imports. Replace imported
  `text_*` helpers with methods on strings, `array_first(values)` with
  `values.first()`, and `array_sort_by(values, @compare)` with
  `values.sort_by(@compare)`. The option/result modules retain explicitly
  imported `option_value_or` and `result_value_or` helpers.

### Language and runtime

- Text and collection methods are available without imports, including
  `.ends_with()`, `.first()` and stable `.sort_by()`. Standard method names
  cannot be captured by unrelated global functions. Suffix matching is literal
  and case-sensitive; sorting requires a pure comparator.
- Add experimental `async`/`await`, `AsyncFn` references and typed fake-read
  completions, with checked effects and nested suspension. This is a bounded
  experiment: no real networking, source spawning or resource scopes.
- Replace native-recursive calls with owned resumable VM frames and an internal
  budgeted execution API. Add fake-host task/lifecycle experiments with scoped
  joins, bounded completion queues, virtual deadlines and cancellation cleanup.
- Amortise persistent array append while preserving immutable value semantics.

### Website and development

- Add a browser playground using the existing compiler and VM through
  WebAssembly, with nine editable examples and a visual explanation of execution.
  Source compilation and execution stay on the user's device. Host capabilities
  remain more limited than the downloadable native toolchain.
- Version the complete playground asset set together to avoid mixing cached
  examples, workers, compiler and standard library across deployments.
- Expand the website's examples, installation guide and engineering information;
  publish native C coverage reports alongside it.
- Reduce duplicated validation work, reuse safe build artifacts, overlap suites
  and partition hosted checks. Keep unit, functional, bootstrap and exact-package
  gates, with additional browser checks in Chromium, Firefox and WebKit.

## 0.1.0-alpha.9 — 2026-09-26

- Add `stdlib/testing` assertions and ordered reports, `stdlib/testing_files`
  fixture discovery and temporary workspaces, and `stdlib/testing_commands`
  byte-exact child-process and host-error assertions.
- Complete repository-wide Python removal. Development tests, bootstrap,
  conformance, packaging and release validation now use Panackelty, C and
  standard host tools. A tested source policy rejects interpreter dependencies;
  Linux and macOS CI also validate with Python unavailable from `PATH`.
- Regenerate the compiler seed through verified self-hosted stages, checking
  its input digest, compiler and standard-library fixed points, and expected
  conformance output before publication.
- Replace live compiler/VM oracles with reviewed portable fixtures and fixed
  independent arithmetic expectations, preserving native fault-injection,
  sanitizer and branch-coverage gates.
- Reject Void-valued call arguments such as `print(print(1))`, which the
  self-hosted checker previously accepted incorrectly. The compiler seed is
  updated; bytecode remains version 8.
- Known development limitation: clean validation still exceeds its 120-second
  target. Validation-speed improvements are the next engineering priority;
  coverage and failure checks remain intact.

## 0.1.0-alpha.8 — 2026-09-24

- Split the native VM into separately compiled modules, with self-contained
  headers, clearer formatting and documented ownership contracts.
- Fix cleanup after allocation failures in decoding, record construction,
  frame growth, interpolation, arithmetic and nested execution. Failed
  allocations now trap instead of leaving incomplete runtime values.
- Correct full-width unsigned integer conversion and make exact decimal
  comparison independent of allocation success.
- Exact decimal division removes redundant fractional trailing zeros to match
  the reference interpreter: `1.00 / 2.0` now prints `0.5` and `0.00 / 2.0`
  prints `0`. Bytecode remains version 8.
- Expand VM tests with allocation/syscall fault injection, persistent ownership
  sequences, rich bytecode mutations and seeded numeric properties. CI runs
  native sanitizers and publishes line/branch coverage reports.

## 0.1.0-alpha.7 — 2026-09-24

- Typed filesystem APIs accept `Path` and return structured `HostError` values:
  bounded byte I/O, sorted directory enumeration, symlink-aware metadata,
  directory creation/removal, and explicitly owned temporary files/directories.
- Process execution supports exact executable paths, arguments, working
  directories, environment overrides, concurrent byte streams, output limits,
  and monotonic timeouts. Nonzero exits remain completed process results;
  launch failures, timeouts, and limit failures are separate errors.
- Checked UTF-8 decoding and exact-duration sleep complete the initial host API.
  Negative or oversized sleep/timeout durations are rejected before execution.
- Bytecode remains version 8; these APIs require the updated compiler and VM.
  The prelude exports new host, filesystem, and process types, so conflicting
  user declarations must be renamed or imports narrowed.
- This POSIX preview does not promise atomic writes, recursive filesystem
  operations, secure path/process containment, or portable suspension timing.

## 0.1.0-alpha.6 — 2026-09-24

- Opaque `Path` values preserve POSIX native filenames, with checked text/byte
  construction, escaped display, and pure lexical operations.
- Exact signed nanosecond `Duration` values support arithmetic, rational seconds,
  and checked division without rounding.
- Opaque monotonic `Instant` readings support deadlines and elapsed time. Clock
  reads are effectful and return structured errors; arithmetic remains pure.
- Bytecode remains version 8. New APIs require the updated compiler and VM;
  older runtimes reject their new builtin calls. Existing string path helpers
  remain for bootstrap compatibility.

## 0.1.0-alpha.5 — 2026-09-24

- Exact `Rat` values: integer `/` produces a normalized fraction; arithmetic with
  integers stays rational. `.nat()` and `.dec()` convert exactly or trap.
- First-class `Unit`, written `()`, supports generic success payloads such as
  `Result[Unit,Str]`, collections, and callbacks while remaining distinct from Void.
- Breaking change: bytecode 8 replaces version 7. Recompile existing artifacts.
  Replace truncating natural division with `quotient(a, b)`; existing `Dec`
  division keeps its exact-decimal behavior. Rounded conversions remain deferred.

## 0.1.0-alpha.4 — 2026-09-24

### Highlights

- Generic source functions with abstract body checking, inference from all value
  arguments, explicit complete type arguments, receiver-first calls, recursion,
  and purity preservation. Type arguments erase into ordinary version-7 calls.
- Portable `option_value_or[T]`, `result_value_or[T,E]`, and `array_first[T]`
  standard-library helpers, with a runnable generic-functions example.
- A VM execution guide with actual instruction listings, recorded execution
  traces, and tested arithmetic, branch/call, and loop examples.

### Compatibility

- Bytecode remains version 7. Generic calls erase type arguments and retain one
  ordinary function body; the native VM instruction set is unchanged.
- Constraints, generic function references, partial type arguments, and
  return-context inference remain deferred. Generic callbacks require a
  non-generic wrapper.
- The standard library exports three new helper names. Imports still share a
  program-wide namespace, so programs declaring the same names must rename
  them or narrow their imports.
- This remains an experimental preview for Linux x86-64 and macOS arm64 under
  the existing release policy.

## 0.1.0-alpha.3 — 2026-09-15

### Highlights

- Local bindings may omit type annotations: `name = value` declares an immutable
  local when the name is not visible, and `mut name = value` declares a mutable
  local. Assignments retain fixed types and require mutability; shadowing remains
  prohibited. An unknown assignment target now declares a local instead of
  reporting an unknown-name error.
- Inferred initializers must determine complete types without evidence from later
  statements. Nested collection and constructor evidence combines consistently;
  unresolved types request an annotation. Numeric defaults, guarded domain types,
  and callable effects are preserved. Function signatures remain explicit.

### Compatibility

- Assigning to an unknown local name now declares an immutable binding instead
  of reporting an error. A misspelled assignment can therefore introduce a new
  variable; unused-binding warnings are not yet implemented.
- Existing explicit local annotations remain supported. Function parameters,
  return types, and record fields still require annotations. Incomplete local
  types cannot be resolved from later assignments or uses.
- Bytecode remains version 7. This is an experimental preview for Linux x86-64
  and macOS arm64 under the compatibility policy in `RELEASE_POLICY.md`.

## 0.1.0-alpha.2 — 2026-09-15

### Highlights

- Positioned compiler errors now include numbered source excerpts and carets,
  including imported modules. Source snapshots, four-column tabs, and visible
  Unicode/control escapes keep excerpts accurate and aligned.
- Faster native string operations and self-hosted compiler validation, with
  cached character metadata and direct indexing for ASCII strings.
- Validation and packaging now support source checkout paths containing spaces.
- Optimised native builds, reusable unit-test compiler probes, and reduced
  duplicate CI work keep development feedback within the validation budgets.

### Compatibility

- The accepted language syntax and bytecode format remain unchanged (version 7).
- Diagnostic output now includes source lines and carets after positioned
  headers. Tools that consume compiler stderr should allow these extra lines.
- This remains an experimental preview for Linux x86-64 and macOS arm64,
  subject to the compatibility policy in `RELEASE_POLICY.md`.

## 0.1.0-alpha.1 — 2026-09-04

The first public developer preview.

### Highlights

- Self-hosted Panackelty compiler running on the native C11 VM
- Arbitrary-precision `Nat` and `Int` values and exact base-10 `Dec` arithmetic
- Guarded domain types and explicit pure/effectful function boundaries
- Records, generic tagged unions, exhaustive matching, persistent collections,
  callable values, modules, and a bundled standard library
- Verified, deterministic version-7 bytecode
- `check`, `compile`, `run`, and `disasm` commands
- Python-free, relocatable download archives with SHA-256 checksums and build
  provenance for both supported platforms
- Download-first quick start and a compact tour backed by packaged, tested
  example programs
- Primary `file:line:column` locations for lexer, parser, name-resolution, and
  type-checking failures, including failures in imported modules
- A structured public bug-report form that collects version, platform, minimal
  input, reproduction command, expected behavior, and complete output

### Preview limitations

- Source and standard-library compatibility are not yet stable
- Bytecode compatibility is not promised across Panackelty releases
- The initial binary targets are Linux x86-64 and macOS arm64
- Windows, package management, concurrency, generic source functions, traits,
  and a single-file executable are not included
- Diagnostics outside the primary lexer, parser, name, and type failures do not
  yet consistently include source locations; source excerpts are not rendered

See `RELEASE_POLICY.md`, `SPEC.md`, and `ROADMAP.md` for the complete preview
contract and remaining work.

### Release verification

- Published from annotated tag `v0.1.0-alpha.1`; each provenance file records
  the exact tagged source commit
- Passed complete validation and exact-archive smoke tests on Ubuntu 22.04
  x86-64 and macOS 14 arm64 in the release workflow
- Published exactly two archives with adjacent SHA-256 checksums and build
  provenance, all tied to the tagged source commit
- Downloaded all six public assets from the GitHub release and independently
  verified both archive checksums
- Repeated the packaged quick start with the downloaded macOS arm64 archive;
  the downloaded Linux checksum matched the exact archive exercised by the
  Ubuntu release job
